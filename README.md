# Welcome to Lotus ðŸª·

**Lotus** is a web-based writing app that supports [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

Lotus is written in vanilla [React](https://react.dev) with some CSS for styling. It uses an open-source Markdown library for React which you can find [here](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown).

Some inspirations for Lotus are:

- **[Merlot](https://merlot.vercel.app)**: Merlot by Linus [@thesephist](https://thesephist.com/) is the biggest inspiration for building this project. I was going through some of his projects when I came across Merlot and I've since wanted to build a similar markdown editor. This project is *heavily* influenced by Merlot. Do check it out!
- **[Typehere.co](https://typehere.co)**: "A persistent textarea that will hold on to your shit."

I've always wanted to build a personal note-taking application. Earlier this year, I began using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for note-taking.  That's when I truly started using markdown for notes. Obsidian is incredibly powerful, but it is also quite heavy. Lotus is a relatively simpler, lighter, and more accessible markdown editor.

Lotus stores all your data locally. If you clear site data for Lotus, you'll notice that all your notes are gone. However, refreshing the page won't change a thing. I found Merlot to be slow, and that's why Lotus is built to process in real-time. Lotus is web-based, so you can access it from any device!

TLDR:

- Locally stored notes (your data is safe)
- Real-time processing
- Dark/Light Modes
- 3 Preview Modes
- Accessible on all devices
- Free!

I hope you enjoy Lotus. Try it out now, by editing in your own text! Thanka:)
